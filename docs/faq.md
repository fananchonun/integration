<details><summary><b>What is HACS?</b></summary>
</br>
HACS is an abbreviation of "Home Assistant Community Store".
</br></br>
Although "Store" is not "technically" correct, since nothing is sold, it's more like a marketplace? but "HACM" didn't have the same ring to it.
</br></br>
<b>Higlighs of what HACS can do:</b>
</br>
- Help you discover new integrations and plugins.
</br>
- Help you install (download) new integrations and plugins.
</br>
- Help you keep track of your integrations and plugins.
</br></br>

<details><summary><b>Is this for hass.io only?</b></summary>
</br>
No, it's not.
</br>
You can use this on _any_ Home Assistant installation.
</br></br>
<i>Windows might have issues, but if you are running HA on Windows you are probably used to that.</i>
</br></br>

<details><summary><b>How does it work: Installation</b></summary>
</br>
When you install an element this is what's happening:
</br>
1. The local target directory(folder) is deleted.
</br>
2. A new local target directory is created.
</br>
3. All expected files are downloaded to that directory.
</br></br>

<details><summary><b>How does it work: Upgrade</b></summary>
</br>
The same as installation.
