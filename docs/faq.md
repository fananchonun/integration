<details><summary><b>What is HACS?</b></summary>

HACS is an abbreviation of "Home Assistant Community Store".

Although "Store" is not "technically" correct, since nothing is sold, it's more like a marketplace? but "HACM" didn't have the same ring to it.

**Higlighs of what HACS can do:**

- Help you discover new integrations and plugins.
- Help you install (download) new integrations and plugins.
- Help you keep track of your integrations and plugins.

<details><summary><b>Is this for hass.io only?</b></summary>

No, it's not.
You can use this on _any_ Home Assistant installation.

_Windows might have issues, but if you are running HA on Windows you are probably used to that._

<details><summary><b>How does it work: Installation</b></summary>

When you install an element this is what's happening:

1. The local target directory(folder) is deleted.
1. A new local target directory is created.
1. All expected files are downloaded to that directory.

<details><summary><b>How does it work: Upgrade</b></summary>

The same as installation.
