This integration is **massive** and there are a lot of areas to contribute to.

Contributions to the docs, will almost be blindly accepted.

_All contributions should go against the `master` branch._

### For contributions to the integration itself (backend/frontend)

If the contribution is minor, make the change and open a PR (Pull Request).

For new features, changes to existing features, or other big changes, please open an RFC (Request for comment) issue before you start the work.
